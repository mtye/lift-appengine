IMPORTANT NOTICE:

In order to upload this application to the Google App Engine, you will first
have to edit the src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml configuration
file and change the value <application></application> element to the
application ID you registered with the App Engine Admin Console. For more
information, see:

http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/config/appconfig.html


Also, the standard Maven configuration has been altered to build the
exploded webapp in the "<project>/war" directory, instead of the default
"<project>/target/${artifactId}-${version}" directory. The Google Plugin
for Eclipse requires the exploded webapp to be located in the "war" directory
in order to to run and and debug your application with the built-in server.
